The data needs to be pre-processed first by removing stop words and using lemmatization. 
Then, an index needs to be created for our dataset. By using an inverted index, term frequency and inverse document frequency the computation weight of each word in a document can show the represenation of importance each word is in the document.

TF: Term Frequency, measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Documents are different in length, so the terms would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Then, the term frequency is divided by the document length :

IDF: Inverse Document Frequency, measures the importance a term is. While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However certain terms, such as "is", "of", and "that", may appear a lot of times but have little importance, which are stop-words that are removed at data pre-processing. So we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing the following:

TF-IDF: Term frequency - Inverse document frequency is a weighting scheme that assigns each term in a document a weight based on its term frequency and inverse document frequency. A high weight in tfâ€“idf is reached by a high term frequency (in the given document) and a low document frequency of the term in the whole collection of documents. The terms with higher weight scores are considered to be more important.
